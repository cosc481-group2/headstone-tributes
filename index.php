                        Burial is simply a ritual act of placing the deceased into the ground. The earliest human burial dates back 100,000 years making it one of the longest-lived and most widespread of traditions. Burial is often seen as a sign of respect for the deceased. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life.

                        A will is a legal document that says who should have your property or care for your children after your death. If you own any property or have children under 18, you may want to create a will. If you donâ€™t have a will, those decisions will be made for you according to state law.
                        <br><br>
                        Wills can take many forms. There are several requirements a will has to meet to be considered valid after your death. Planning for the end of your life can be complicated. You may want to talk to a lawyer to ensure that your wishes are carried out.
